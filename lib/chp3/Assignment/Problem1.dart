// Question 1 is asking you to create a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and computes both its area and perimeter.

void main(){
  
 int width = 10;
 int length =20;
 //Use of arithmmetic operator 
 print("Area of rectangle ${length*width}");
 print("Perimeter is ${2*(length+width)}");

  //print() function
