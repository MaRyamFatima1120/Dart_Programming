/*
    Operator precedence, also known as operator priority, determines the order
     in which operators are evaluated in an expression that contains multiple operators.
     It defines the grouping and sequence of operations based on the relative priority of 
     different operators.
    Each operator in a programming language is assigned a precedence level.
     Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.
     If operators have the same precedence, their evaluation order is determined by their 
     associativity, which can be either left-to-right or right-to-left.
