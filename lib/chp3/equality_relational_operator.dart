  /* 
    Equality and relational operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean value (true or false) based on the comparison result. 
  
    Here are the commonly used equality and relational operators in Dart:

  // 1. Equality Operators:

  // Equal to (==): Returns true if the operands are equal, otherwise false.
  // Not equal to (!=): Returns true if the operands are not equal, otherwise false.

  var x=10,y=10;
  print(x==y);
  print(x!=y);


  //2.Relational Operators:
  //greateer than
  print(x>y);
  //less than 
  print(x<y);
  //greateer than or equal to
  print(x>=y);

  //less than or equal to
  print(x<=y);
