// Introduction to Loops:

// Loops are an essential concept in programming that allow us to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a certain condition or for a specified number of times. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and make programs more efficient and flexible. Loops provide a way to iterate over a collection of data or perform a specific action until a particular condition is met.


// Benefits of using loops in programming:


// 1. Efficiency: Loops help reduce code redundancy by executing a block of code multiple times, eliminating the need to write the same code repeatedly.

// 2. Automation: Loops automate repetitive tasks, making the program more efficient and less error-prone.

// 3. Flexibility: Loops provide the flexibility to iterate over a collection of data and perform actions dynamically based on the current iteration.

// 4. Scalability: Loops allow programs to handle large amounts of data by processing each element systematically.

// 5. Code Readability: By using loops, programmers can write concise and readable code that is easy to understand and maintain.





// Different types of loops in Dart:

// for loop: Executes a block of code for a specific number of times based on a defined condition.

// while loop: Continuously executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

// do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once and then repeats the execution as long as a given condition is true.

// for-in loop: Iterates over the elements of a collection (such as a list or a map) and executes a block of code for each element.

// These different types of loops provide flexibility in controlling the flow of execution and allow programmers to handle various scenarios where repetitive actions or iterations are required.
